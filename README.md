# Read and Chat GUI

Simple GitHub actions UI, run for free, by you, on GitHub.

### [Setup and usage ⏩](#setup)

Developers can [test locally or remotely](#testing) and should evaluate [security claims](#security-claims).

## Setup

Read this on [your new fork][FORK_THIS], and [enable GitHub Actions](../../actions).

![enable actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75504552/219168117-532b555a-c1ea-4745-92fc-a4ffbf4ada8a.png)

Then, set up [GitHub Pages](../../settings/pages) from "actions" and set your ["github-pages" environment](../../settings/environments) to run on any branch or tag.

Finally, publish a [pre-release](../../releases/new) (any tag name you create is fine).

![ok1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75504552/219478759-32a4a252-ab3b-4530-bc6a-e561bf933d64.png)


### Register

Refresh the [latest release](../../releases/latest) until you see a link. In 8 clicks, you'll have a GitHub App on your fork and an updated [release](../../releases/latest). Choose a master password, and you'd have a new login link. Keep your login link and master password privately on each device.

### Configure

The service runs from `UTC 12:03` until `UTC 2:13`. To change this, clone your fork and run `pnpm timer`.

## Security claims

During installation, you and your workflow exchange [OPRF][OPRF] keys. Then, you and your workflows share encrypted messages using [a shared secret][PAKE]. To yield that secret, a login workflow runs a [key exchange][PAKE] with its own [pepper][OPRF] and the salt in your login link. Then, you have a one-off session key for [authenticated][GCM] encryption.

Afterwards, all transmitted data is always encrypted both with an [Argon2][Argon2] hash unknown to your workflows and with your [shared secret][PAKE] for each login session.

### Security limitations

To **update or delete** your data, 
- You need your master password
- **AND** your personal login link

Reset your master password if you reveal it as well as your login link. Don't give others write access to your fork: ⚠️ Don't add [collaborators][HELP_COLLAB] to your fork; ☠️ Don't let your GitHub account [be compromised][HELP_SECURE].

If they have write access to your fork, they can **erase** your data.

## Local Installation 

- In [environment.csv](./client/environment.csv), set `REMOTE` to `your_username/read-and-chat-gui`.
- Open a terminal, and clone your forked repository:

```properties
YOU=your_username
REPO_URL=$YOU/read-and-chat-gui
git clone git@github.com:$REPO_URL.git
cd read-and-chat-gui
```

Install `pnpm`, `node 18`, and dependencies:

```properties
wget -qO- https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
pnpm env use --global 18
pnpm install -g node-gyp
CXX=gcc pnpm install
```

#### Automated Local Testing

Run `npx playwright install`, to download latest browsers.

Run `pnpm test:config` to write GitHub credentials to .env.test. This is only needed when running automated tests locally. Then run `pnpm test` to run all client-side tests. Run `pnpm test:ideas` to start making new tests.

#### Manual Local Testing

Run `pnpm dev clean`, then open `localhost:8000` in a browser. To clean up after manual tests, delete [your old development app](https://github.com/settings/apps) and remove `.env`. Ensure `pnpm dev clean` or `pnpm dev` is running to resume testing. To update expired local installation tokens, run `bash develop.bash UPDATE`.
